# Encapsulation with the constructor and prototype pattern

## Instructions

At a high level, this week is about building an effective process for learning unfamiliar language features and patterns.  In this workshop, you'll practice using this process to understand some code that uses the constructor and prototype pattern.

You'll also write some code that uses this pattern to encapsulate some behaviour.

### Getting visibility

A great way to understand code is to first tighten the loop, then get visibility.  In this workshop, we'll practice getting visibility.  As you go through the workshop, try using `console.log()` to inspect the values of:

* Variables
* Parameters
* Function return values

### Investigate the CountModel code sample (20 mins)

* Pair up.

* Clone this repo.

* Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.  Open the browser console.  You should see `count is 0`.

* Open `index.js` in your text editor.  Play around with the code using the techniques for getting visibility. Answer the questions that are in comments.  Discuss your answers with your pair partner.

### Encapsulate some behaviour with the constructor and prototype pattern (20 mins)

Use the constructor and prototype pattern to implement the user stories below.  You can draw on the OO skills you learnt in the first four weeks of the course.  Don't be afraid to diagram! Strive for good encapsulation.

#### User Stories

```
As a shepherd
So my sheep can be safe
I want to have a pen they can go into
```

```
As a shepherd
So my sheep can be friends
I want them to be able to say their names
```

```
As a shepherd
So I can know all my sheep are home
I want to get a list of all the names of the sheep in the pen
```
